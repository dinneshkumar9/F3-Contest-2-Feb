Restaurant website

Project Overview
Objective:
To create a website for a restaurant that includes 5 functions to handle various tasks such as getting the menu, taking orders, order preparation, payment, and displaying a thank you message.

Function 1: getMenu()
This function will fetch the food items from an API and display them to the user when the screen loads.
API URL: https://free-food-menus-api-production.up.railway.app/burgers

Steps:

Call the API using the fetch() method.
Parse the JSON response.
Display the food items to the user.


Function 2: takeOrder()
This function will simulate the user placing an order. It will randomly select 3 burgers, add them to an object, and then return a Promise that resolves after 2500 milliseconds.

Steps:

Create a Promise.
Use a setTimeout() function to wait for 2500 milliseconds.
Select 3 burgers randomly.
Add the burgers to an object.
Resolve the Promise with the object.
Function 3: orderPrep()
This function will simulate the order preparation process. It will return a Promise that resolves after 1500 milliseconds with the object {order_status:true, paid:false}.

Steps:

Create a Promise.
Use a setTimeout() function to wait for 1500 milliseconds.
Create an object with the order status and payment status.
Resolve the Promise with the object.
Function 4: payOrder()
This function will simulate the payment process. It will return a Promise that resolves after 1000 milliseconds with the object {order_status:true, paid:true}.

Steps:

Create a Promise.
Use a setTimeout() function to wait for 1000 milliseconds.
Create an object with the order status and payment status.
Resolve the Promise with the object.
Function 5: thankyouFnc()
This function will display a thank you message once the payment is received. It will be called after the payOrder() function is resolved and the paid status is true.

Steps:

Display a thank you message using an alert() function.
